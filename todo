Here's things it might be useful to add. 

- High Availability in general
- moving to a distributed database (likely aurora serverless running mysql)
- move to read-only container (reuires remote database replace sqlite)
- proper frontend (TBD - Nginx or gunicorn or something. Researching)
- magical credential management (auto-upload of creds on server restart)
- settings tab (password change)
- auto-blackhole of abusive incoming IPs (scanners and bots and such) based on 404 and other behaviors
- automatic account key rotation
- dark mode (or themes in general)
- disable inactive users (> 90 days)
- force MFA check as part of registration so we know it works
- Drop external references to CDNs - they break on the corporate VPN (sigh)

More wild future ideas:

- script support with policy delegation (APIkeys) - tons of security concerns to address here.
- maybe maybe moving role admin to online, and assigning owners to roles, to distribute the admin duties directly to those concerned.
- credential editor (ie. not just a text editor)
- a complete rewrite from the ground up
- PWA front-end and server is pure API
